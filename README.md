🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m Emnet Befkadu, a dedicated full stack developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. I build responsive and dynamic applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React on the frontend, and Java, PHP, and MySQL on the backend.

My passion for development has driven me to constantly learn and build real-world projects, both independently and in team settings. I’ve also taken part in tech communities like GDG, where I enhanced my skills and participated in a hackathon where my team placed second. Through these experiences, I’ve grown not only as a developer but also as a collaborator who values teamwork, problem-solving, and delivering high-quality solutions.
